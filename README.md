# Medical Data Visualizer  

This project uses Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize medical examination data. It generates both categorical plots and a heatmap to explore relationships between different health indicators.  

The analysis includes:  

- Calculating BMI and classifying individuals as overweight  
- Normalizing cholesterol and glucose data for consistency  
- Creating a categorical bar plot to compare variables across patients with and without cardiovascular disease  
- Cleaning the dataset by filtering out incorrect or extreme values  
- Generating a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between medical attributes  

The project was built as part of the **[freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer)** curriculum.
